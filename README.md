# Misc React Exercises

## Autocomplete widget
The idea for this came from a tutorial:  [How To Build an Autocomplete Component in React](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/react-react-autocomplete), but I did not
peek at their solution.  Their sandbox demo is [here](https://codesandbox.io/s/8lyp733pj0).  That solution may also be found
in the present project with name **AutocompleteOnline**.

An array of matches should be provided as a property, for example:
```javascript
"Alligator",
"Bask",
"Crocodilian",
"Death Roll",
"Eggs",
"Jaws",
"Reptile",
"Solitary",
"Tail",
"Wetlands"
```
Substring matches should work.

The UI should have a title, brief instructions, and an &lt;input&gt; field. An initial message appears when there are no matches, or empty input.

Matches should be incremental, results change as you type.

Matches appear as a kind of &lt;select&gt; attached to the bottom of the &lt;input&gt;.

Css styling should apply to the &lt;select&gt; options:

1. The first one is highlighted by default; this is the current selection
2. As the mouse hovers over any others below the first, they also highlight in addition to the current selection
3. The up and down arrow keys will move the current selection up and down.

When clicking on an option, or pressing Return on a highlighted option:
1. The &lt;input&gt; is replaced with the full text of the current selection
2. The options list vanishes

## Calc
Code challenge was 2020-12-01, in a Zoom call with Todd Lunter of Upserve.

The original instructions are in the pdf `UpserveInstructions.pdf`.

A code sandbox version is here:  https://codepen.io/fishtaco1/pen/xxEwbye

## Colorswitch
This challenge was presented to me during an interview with Dun & Bradstreet on 2020-11-18

## Counter
Original source:  toptal.com code challenge, June 2022.  Simple demonstration 
of a state variable, using the old-fashioned *class* approach to components.

## FixThisToDo
This challenge was presented to me during an interview with [CAA](http://caa.com) in October 2025.  I was presented with
the code in unfixed.tsx, and the solution is in fixed.tsx.

## Form Validation
This challenge came from an interview with GoDaddy with interviewer Alex Chen, 2022-08-04.  We used this sandbox:
https://codesandbox.io/s/form-challenge-forked-3kfhq0?file=/src/styles.css:0-103

## Form Validation with HTML5
Variation on the `Form Validation` exercise, taking advantage of built-in
HTML5 validation features, using custom validation messages.  HTML5 validation
is probably not a good solution for form validation.  Some hackery
was needed to make it work, and it is still less than ideal.

## Form Validation with react-hook-form
Variation on the `Form Validation` exercise, using the [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/)
library.

## Form Validation with Formik
Variation on the `Form Validation` exercise, using the [Formik](https://formik.org/)
library.

## Infinite Scroll
From a job interview code challenge on 2022-06-15 (forgot who the employer was).
Retrieves movie data from service at `omdbapi.com` and displays results ten at a time with 
infinite scroll. The api is described at [https://www.omdbapi.com](https://www.omdbapi.com).

## MUI Table
This was a challenge I posed to myself.

## OrganizeTeams
This challenge comes from [React Coding Interview Challenge 21](https://medium.com/@justin.sherman/react-coding-interview-challenge-21-c4fc68c823a3).

I tweaked the requirements to include clicking on player inside their
team boxes, which make them return to the player pool.

## Pagination (from scratch)
Paginated tabular data, home-made with no UI library.

This challenge comes from [React Coding Interview Challenge 18](https://medium.com/@justin.sherman/react-coding-interview-challenge-18-257bbcb7429a).

## Pagination (with a library)
Paginated tabular data rendered by [Material React Table](https://www.material-react-table.com/) which is based on
[Material UI (a.k.a. MUI)](https://mui.com/).

## Quiz
This challenge comes from [React Coding Interview Challenge 8](https://medium.com/@justin.sherman/react-coding-interview-challenge-8-f852c6d19385).

## StarRating
This challenge comes from [React Coding Interview Challenge 12](https://medium.com/@justin.sherman/react-coding-interview-challenge-12-b8d7d13c96e6).

My approach uses a <Star> component for each star.  The clicked and hover
states are stored at the parent level and the state variables and setter
are passed down as props.  Although the <Star> component approach is
good React style, the state management is overly busy.

## StarRatingPublished
The solution published in the original article (see link above). More concise
than my solution, but at the cost of having no <Star> child component.
Also it avoids the use of loops that were in my solution.  But the
hover requirement does not appear to have been met correctly (hovers are
overriding previously clicked stars).

## ToDoList
A pretty standard, bare bones ToDo List.  Clicking on each ToDo toggles
it as done vs in progress, and text at the bottom tallies incomplete
vs complete tasks. Original source:  code challenge from toptal.com, June 2022.

## UseAsync Hook (work in progress)
Source: [The Hook I Use in Every React Project (Youâ€™ll Want It Too)](https://medium.com/full-stack-forge/the-hook-i-use-in-every-react-project-youll-want-it-too-50a504b1b854)

## WordByWord
This challenge comes from [React Coding Interview Challenge 20](https://medium.com/@justin.sherman/react-coding-interview-challenge-20-87d5707ecefe).

My version accomplishes it with DOM manipulation.  It works, but admittedly
direct DOM manipulation is not in the spirit of React.

My version does not require a submit button or RETURN press, it 
automatically starts printing on any newly typed input.

## WordByWordPublished 
The solution published in the original article (see link above).  It
uses state instead of DOM manipulation (which is good React style)
but it is doing more work because it re-renders the whole output,
plus the latest new word, every 500 msec. Their version uses a submit
button, which is a better user experience.
